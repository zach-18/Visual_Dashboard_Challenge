# Visual_Dashboard_Challenge
Week 15 Homework

I began working on this assignment by breaking it up into chunks.
I was able to access the data by testing code in console.log.
I was able also to use code from google to figure out how to populate
the filter with the test subject No.

I started to build the line chart, and had accessed the data, and 
created the plotly framework.  However, it did not refresh w/ the 
filter selection.

My tutor helped me with that.  Functions provide the solution, but to 
be honest, I am still not completely able to utilize functions comfortably.

After that, I used a more old school way to build the table for 
the demographics, but it is using a function so that it gets updated
as you select a new person.

I was also able to host the site online using GitHub.

FYI, to show my earlier work, I included a lot of the code / console.log
that I had created prior to meeting my tutor.

I did not finish the gauge chart.
